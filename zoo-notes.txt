======ZOO======
0. review ZOO source code. what languages is it written? what are the potential flaws of it? C. its really really good!
1. how to host ZOO?
2. other alternatives of ZOO? az functions, ....
3. next meeting with gerald
	tell me more about the architecture of the software: 
		how its build
			what does each component do exactly? API, Kernel, Client, Services
		how it supports all the languages?
		what security mechanisems are integrated? 
		how you think the performance is gonna be? 
		how can I integrate my existing script in it?
		what is your vision with Zoo project? What do you like it to become? 
			what are the obstacles on the way? 
		
		
	things I really liked:
		service chaining
		supporting all languages
		
		
--------Zoo Hosting---------
1. Amazong ECS
1. Az App Services
	--> Fail: Docker-compose is in preview. it doesnt support a long docker-compose file like the one we have.\
1. Azure Container Apps
	--> Fail: Single container only
2. Az Functions (also try single scripts here)
3. AKS
4. ACI
	--> Fail: only making a single container available online
5. AZ VMs
6. Automate it using DevOps Approach


-----Zoo to AKS----
- There is a problem with the websocketd deployment. you need to put the file ./zoo-project/zoo-services/utils/open-api/server/subscriber.py somewhere accessible. For eaxmple in docker dir (./docker/webscoketd/subscriber.py)


----Automate AKS Deployment-----
az group create -n azurelearn -l westeurope
cd /mnt/d/web-development/ZOO-Project/
az deployment group create -g azurelearn -n zoo-cluster-deployment --template-file ./aks-template/template.json --parameters "./aks-template/parameters.json"
az acr login -n zoocr
docker push zoocr.azurecr.io/zoo-project-websocketd:v1
export KUBECONFIG=/mnt/c/Users/Gebruiker/.kube/config
az aks get-credentials -g azurelearn -n zoo-k8-cluster
